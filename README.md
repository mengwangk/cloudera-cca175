# Cloudera CCA175 - Spark and Hadoop Developer

The [Cloudera VMs](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms/5-12.html "Cloudera VMs") require lot of machine resources and this could be a challenge for those who want to obtain CCA175 certification, but do not have a powerful machine. 

Also, for learning purpose it is better to be more hands on and actually configure the tools and utilities by yourself. Here I collected the resources as part of my learning for this certification to install them in my MacBook.
